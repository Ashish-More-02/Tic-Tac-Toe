I have build the basic functionality of this app , and there can be many more cool things 
to add to it, but it would take a lot of time , so i am leaving it in this state for now !

please contribute to this project if anyone wants to.


// future improvements 

1. add a 'new game' button 
2. remove the bug of buttons getting clicked when baground is blured.
3. imporove the UI , and make it mobile friendly (responsive UI)
4. delay the popup of message div
5. fix the bug that redBtn is not working
